1. Light and the External World
Vision begins when light rays from an object enter the eye. These rays can come directly from a light source or they might be reflected off an object.
2. Cornea
The light first encounters the cornea, which is the transparent, dome-shaped surface covering the front of the eye. The cornea bends or refracts these light rays.
3. Iris and Pupil
Light then passes through the pupil, the black circular opening in the center of the colored iris. The size of the pupil changes based on the iris's contraction or relaxation in response to the brightness of light.
4. Lens
After passing through the pupil, light goes through the lens. The lens further refracts the light to focus it onto the retina, a layer of light-sensitive cells at the back of the eye. The shape of the lens changes (accommodation) to focus on objects at varying distances.
5. Retina and Photoreceptors
The retina contains two main types of photoreceptors: rods and cones.
Rods: More numerous and sensitive to low light levels. They are responsible for night and peripheral vision. However, rods don't detect color.
Cones: Concentrated in the central part of the retina called the fovea. They are responsible for sharp, detailed central vision (visual acuity) and color perception. There are three types of cones sensitive to long wavelengths (red), medium wavelengths (green), and short wavelengths (blue).
6. Transformation to Electrical Signals
When light hits the photoreceptors, a series of biochemical events get triggered, converting light into electrical signals.
7. Transmission to the Brain
The electrical signals from the rods and cones travel to a group of cells called the bipolar and ganglion cells. From the ganglion cells, the signals move down their long projections (axons) which are bundled together to form the optic nerve.
The point where the optic nerve leaves the eye (and where there are no photoreceptors) is the blind spot.
8. Optic Chiasm and Optic Tracts
The optic nerves from both eyes meet at the optic chiasm. Here, fibers from the inner half of each retina cross over to the opposite side of the brain, while those from the outer half do not. This ensures that signals from the left visual field of both eyes are processed in the right hemisphere of the brain and vice-versa.
After the chiasm, the fibers are called optic tracts.
9. Processing in the Brain
The optic tracts end in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus, a relay station in the brain. From there, signals are sent to the primary visual cortex located in the occipital lobe at the back of the brain.
Within the visual cortex and other connected areas of the brain, the information is processed to recognize patterns, judge distance, detect movement, identify colors, and much more.
10. Perception
What we "see" is the result of the brain's interpretation of electrical signals. This means vision is not just about the eyes but involves significant brain processing to create meaningful perceptions.
It's important to note that this is a simplified overview. The actual processes, particularly in the brain, are immensely intricate and involve multiple pathways and areas of coordination.
